## Bitcoin and Democracy

For talking about blockchain technology, indeed we are talking about a topic of **democracy** of technology
that will disrupt the whole tech industry. 

I am really don't want to discuss about the advantages/weaknesses of dictatorship and democracy (or centralized and decentralized), 
but the blockchain has the potential to realize the democracy of technology. In a long term, technology companies controlled nearly all the core
infrastrutures, services and data. Our social media information, business processes and lots of private data are stored and managed by
a few tech magnates. The IT service and data collection are highly concentrated. We have no choice but trust the companies who are collecting, 
keeping the data and providing services.

Their collected and controlled data increase every day, their power to manupulate the ecomomy and mankinds' wellbeing become stronger and stronger. 
Giving the trust and such power to commercial organzations is not wise and safe for human being as whole, even if they claim "Don't be evil." or "Respect privacy".
It is not easy for us to change the situation in short time, but blockchain have showed us the morning twilight of democracy of technology.Let's have a glim of these
applications and platforms that may change the internet and even whole tech industry.

1. **Bitcoin** is designed to become a decentralized and secure digital currency. Despite the dramatic fluctuation
of exchange rate with legal tender(USD, RMB...), Despite some solvable but annoying issues, it works well so far.
2. **Etherium** is another populuar applicaiton of blockchain. The Etherium has introduced a new concept named smart contract,so
in the ecosytem of ethrium, we have 2 types of transactions, the first one is ordinary digital currency transaction, another one
is smart contract creation. we can create a smart contract with specific terms in code to identify some kind of agreement which will be 
stored in blockchain permanently and will be firmly executed and fulfilled without any third party.
3. **EOS** is expected to be a upgrade for current blockchain prlatforms. It promised to resolve the issues of existing blockchain systems.
It will support millions of transactions in a second compared 7 in bitcoin and dozens in Etherium. It also removed the 'Gas' which means
the cost of transactions, it replaced with stockshare of EOS to allocate usage of the computing power of miners. 
4. **Steemit** is a powerful content sharing platform just like Media, Reddit and Jianshu, but the platform provide a mechanism that reward the writer with Crypto-currency named steem that can
be redeemed to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The user can also use steam to give power to advertise something or support other writers.
